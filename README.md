-The Black Squeaker Project-
by Daniel Pitman 2025

A simple web based audio app to give audience members of the The Black Squeaker Project a cicada instrument to play during the immersive concert.
It replicates the call of a species of cicada, newly identified in South Australia, Atrapsalta AUDAX - or - The Adelaide Black Squeaker.
This is done using webaudio components with lots of natrualisation tweaks.
